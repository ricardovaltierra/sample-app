## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

Clone or fork the <a href="https://github.com/ricardovaltierra/sample-app">repo</a> [git@github.com:ricardovaltierra/sample-app.git].

## How it Works

This app is built on Rails Scaffolding basis, it needs Sqlite3 to proper use on development and Postgre for production. All good stuff is on `/app` folder.

### Running the code


To get started with the app, clone the repo and then install the needed gems:

```
$ bundle install --without production
```

Next, migrate the database:

```
$ rails db:migrate
```

Finally, run the test suite to verify that everything is working correctly:

```
$ rails test
```

If the test suite passes, you'll be ready to run the app in a local server:

```
$ rails server
```
