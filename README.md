## About The Project

This is a derivated implementation of the sample application from [*Ruby on Rails Tutorial:
Learn Web Development with Rails*](https://www.railstutorial.org/)
by [Michael Hartl](http://www.michaelhartl.com/).

The content covered remarks topics like static pages, controllers, models, layouts, partials, mailing, login with cipher-token, password reset, entity relationships, and multimedia handling.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

Clone or fork the <a href="https://github.com/ricardovaltierra/sample-app">repo</a> [git@github.com:ricardovaltierra/sample-app.git].

## How it Works

This whole app is intended to cover most of the functionalities of Rails without using Scaffolding. All of the content is generated from scratch and with a TDD approach. It takes advantage on layout design using Bootstrap and SASS resources aside to including a test suite for integration.

Validations made on models for presence, length, and format aside of using of `has_secure password` method.

Debug information visible on this app on real-time in layouts and use of Gravatars for default user images. Use of SSL to use `https` and propper integration of Cookies and Session variables for handling HTML elements and backend communication actively.

Tokens and Remember Digest for handling data persistence.

Authorization implemented via `before filters` to handle user hierarchy and 'Friendly forwarding' to redirect.

DB population taking advantage of `seed.rb` aside to fixtures created on testing environment.

Partials for every page section and user. Use of Action Mailer to create mails and views for new users with account activations - and password reset - via generated tokens.

Use of SendGrid (Heroku) as a mail service.

Uploading images via CarrierWave using AWS services. Register and create a micropost !

### Running the code


To get started with the app, clone the repo, and then install the needed gems:

```
$ bundle install --without production
```

Next, migrate the database:

```
$ rails db:migrate
```

Finally, run the test suite to verify that everything is working correctly:

```
$ rails test
```

If the test suite passes, you'll be ready to run the app in a local server:

```
$ rails server
```
